blog
====
This repository holds the source files for my blog.

Current workflow:

1. Author posts on branch `author`.
2. Merge `author` onto `master` when posts are ready.
3. Run the `deploy` script, which compiles in publish mode and copies the
    outputted html files into the appropriate directory in my personal
    website (hosted by github).
