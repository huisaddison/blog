Summary: Adventures on two wheels around Seattle.

I recently picked up a used bicycle off Craigslist.  It's a beautiful
steel Schwinn from the 1980s.  

I take it out on joyrides pretty often, and it's an indispensable part
of my daily commute now.  Prior to this I've never cycled regularly.

## Riding along Burke Gilman

My favorite ride to take on a weekend afternoon is the Burke Gilman from
Fremont to its end in Bothell.

192 Brewing lies along the trail, near Kenmore.  It's a nice place to have
a drink and relax for a while before heading home.  

Sunday afternoons feature live blues.

## Riding along the Ship Canal Trail

For a nice, quick ride after work, I head in the opposite direction, along
the Ship Canal Trail towards Discovery Park.  A fantastic viewpoint exists
there, by the Daybreak Star Indian Cultural Center.

The area is almost always unoccupied.  It's particularly nice for clearing
one's head.  

The first time I stopped by, I was reminded of a line
from my favorite children's book series.  "The world is quiet here."
