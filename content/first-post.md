Summary: First post in Pelican.

This is my first post in my new blog, powered by Pelican.  I choose Pelican
primarily because it is written in Python, a versatile language that I enjoy
working with, and because it plays well with MathJax via the [Math 
Render](https://github.com/barrysteyn/pelican_plugin-render_math) plugin.

Please look forward to posts about statistics, cooking, programming, and
amateur photography.  And expect the theme of to change within the coming
days (or weeks!)
