Summary: Discussion of paper on minimax estimation of covariance matrices, continued.

In this post, I will continue my discussion of [Optimal Rates of Convergence
for Covariance Matrix Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3866).  A
discussion of their first result (showing an upper bound on the risk of their
proposed tapering estimator) can be found in a [previous
post]({filename}./discuss-covmat-optimal-convergence-pt1.md).
