Summary: I uploaded a few photographs I took to Flickr.

I recently picked up a new hobby: film photography.

I've been shooting on Kodak Portra (400 speed) film with an old Rolleicord
Twin Lens Reflex.  Aside from being fun, the activity has guided me through
thinking about different factors that affect an image; e.g., latent light,
depth of field, exposure times.  And the cost of each photograph has taught
me to be more deliberate about what to attempt capturing.

After having the film developed at a mom and pop shop down the street from my
parents' house, I scanned it at the Yale [Digital Media Center for the Arts](
http://dmca.yalecollege.yale.edu/), which graciously makes available a
Hasselblad film scanner.  The film scanner costs upwards of ten thousand
dollars (!), according to B&H Photo and Video.  I uploaded a subset of the
scans (jpeg-compressed) to Flickr.

So far the results look pretty good.  This being my first time, I didn't handle
the negatives very well, and there are more than a few artifacts on the
scans.  For that, I apologize.

Later on, I'll try my hand at developing black and white film.
